= Fourier Transform

== Overview

This module establishes the Fourier transform for complex-valued functions on finite-dimensional spaces. The framework is highly general, supporting arbitrary rings with measures and bilinear forms, while also providing specialized notation for the familiar real and complex cases.

== General Framework (VectorFourier)

=== Setup
The general Fourier transform is defined with:
- $ùïú$: A commutative ring
- $V, W$: Modules over $ùïú$ (source and target spaces)
- $e$: An additive character $ùïú ‚Üí "Circle"$ (unitary character)
- $Œº$: A measure on $V$
- $L$: A bilinear form $V √ó W ‚Üí ùïú$
- $E$: A complete normed $‚ÑÇ$-vector space (for values)

=== Definition
The Fourier integral transforms $f : V ‚Üí E$ to a function $W ‚Üí E$:
$$"fourierIntegral"(e, Œº, L, f)(w) = integral_V e(-L(v, w)) dot f(v) space d Œº(v)$$

This general definition encompasses:
- Classical Fourier transform (when $W$ is dual of $V$)
- Fourier transform on inner product spaces
- Discrete and continuous variants

== Special Cases

=== Scalar Case (Namespace Fourier)
When $V = W = ùïú$ and $L$ is multiplication:
$$hat(f)(Œæ) = integral e(-x Œæ) f(x) space d Œº(x)$$

=== Real Fourier Transform
The most familiar case: $V = W = ‚Ñù$, with:
- Character: $e(x) = exp(2 pi i x)$ (denoted $bold(e)$)
- Measure: Lebesgue measure
- Transform: $cal(F) f(Œæ) = integral exp(-2 pi i x Œæ) f(x) space d x$

=== Inner Product Spaces
For $V = W$ an inner product space over $‚Ñù$:
- Bilinear form: $L(v, w) = angle.l v, w angle.r$
- Notation: $cal(F)$ for transform, $cal(F)^(-1) f(v) = cal(F) f(-v)$ for inverse

== Key Properties

=== Norm Bounds
The Fourier transform is bounded:
$$‚Äñ"fourierIntegral"(e, Œº, L, f)(w)‚Äñ ‚â§ integral_V ‚Äñf(v)‚Äñ space d Œº(v)$$

This shows the transform maps $L^1$ functions to bounded functions.

=== Translation Formula
Right translation becomes phase multiplication:
$$cal(F)(f compose (+v_0))(w) = e(L(v_0, w)) dot cal(F) f(w)$$

This is the fundamental translation-modulation duality.

=== Linearity
The Fourier transform is linear:
- $cal(F)(f + g) = cal(F) f + cal(F) g$
- $cal(F)(c dot f) = c dot cal(F) f$ for $c in ‚ÑÇ$

=== Continuity
For integrable $f$, the Fourier transform $cal(F) f$ is continuous.

Requirements:
- $e$ is continuous
- $L$ is continuous
- $W$ has first-countable topology

== Self-Adjointness

=== Fubini's Theorem Application
The Fourier transform satisfies a self-adjointness property:
$$integral_W M(cal(F) f(Œæ), g(Œæ)) space d ŒΩ(Œæ) = integral_V M(f(x), cal(F) g(x)) space d Œº(x)$$

where $M : E √ó F ‚Üí G$ is a continuous bilinear form.

Special case for inner products:
$$angle.l cal(F) f, g angle.r = angle.l f, cal(F) g angle.r$$

This shows the Fourier transform is its own adjoint (up to normalization).

== Convergence

=== Integrability Criterion
The Fourier integral converges if and only if $f$ is integrable:
$$"Integrable"(v ‚Ü¶ e(-L(v, w)) dot f(v)) ‚ü∫ "Integrable"(f)$$

This equivalence holds for each fixed $w in W$.

=== Dominated Convergence
The continuity proof uses dominated convergence:
- Pointwise limit exists for each $w$
- Dominated by $‚Äñf‚Äñ$, which is integrable
- Character $e$ is continuous

== Design Choices

=== Generality vs Familiarity
The module balances:
- Maximum generality (arbitrary rings and measures)
- Familiar special cases (real/complex with standard choices)
- Clean notation for common uses

=== Character Convention
Using additive characters $e : ùïú ‚Üí "Circle"$ provides:
- Uniform treatment of discrete/continuous cases
- Natural connection to Pontryagin duality
- Clean formulation of periodicity

=== Bilinear Form Flexibility
The bilinear form $L$ allows:
- Standard Fourier transform (multiplication)
- Fourier transform on groups (pairing with dual)
- Fourier-Stieltjes transform
- Fractional Fourier transform
