== \1

In this file, we define the relation `\1*, which means that `\1} is little o of
`\1* along the filter `\1}.

Unlike `\1* relations, this one requires `\1} and `\1} to have the same codomain `\1}.
While the definition only requires `\1* to be a `\1}, most interesting properties
require it to be a `\1*.

== \1

We introduce the notation `\1*, which you can use by opening the
`\1* locale.

== \1

If `\1* is a `\1} :

- `\1* is an equivalence relation
- Equivalent statements for `\1* :
- If `\1*, this is true iff `\1} (see `\1})
- For `\1*, this is true iff `\1} (see `\1})

If `\1* is a `\1} :

- Alternative characterization of the relation (see `\1*) :

`\1*

- Provided some non-vanishing hypothesis, this can be seen as `\1*
(see `\1*)
- For any constant `\1*, `\1} implies `\1}
(see `\1*)
- `\1* and `\1} are compatible with `\1} (see `\1} and `\1})

If `\1* is a `\1} :

- If `\1*, we have `\1}
(see `\1*)

== \1

Note that `\1* takes the parameters `\1} in that order.
This is to enable `\1* \support, as `\1} requires that the last two explicit arguments are `\1}.
